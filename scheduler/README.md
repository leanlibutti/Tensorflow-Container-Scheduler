## Scheduler for Tensorflow Programs

Allows planning the executions of different Tensorflow programs. The user must indicate the inter and intra parallelism for each program. The planner is in charge of deciding when the execution takes place depending on the available resources and the chosen planning policy.

Docker is used for the execution of each Tensorflow program.

The whole project is developed in the python language.
